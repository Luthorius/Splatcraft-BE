# Splatcraft
Minecraft Community Project

### Something for everyone.
Splatcraft is a Minecraft Addon inspired heavily by the groundbreaking, squid vs squid title known as "Splatoon". The aim is to create something amazing, half ink spreading mayhem, half planned out survival and resource gathering.
So far, only one person has worked on this project, to give it the initial shape, but this isn't just another minecraft addon, made to be uploaded somewhere and generate cash for the creator through adds, this is open source, for us all to be a part of.


## Contribute!

Hey, everyone is welcome here. To get this project as smooth and as big as planned, do what you want! Add some textures, make some models, design particles, entities, gameplay mechanics! Or just make some structures!
